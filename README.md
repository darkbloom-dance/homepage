# About

Howdy! Thanks for stopping by! I'm Jenni Darkbloom, a burlesque dancer, teacher, and [kitten](https://kittening.darkbloom.dance). I started performing in 2023, and I'm based out of Maine.

# Classes

Sundays at 4pm, I teach [Nerdlesque at Eye Candy in Bangor](https://www.eyecandybangor.com/product/sunday-4pm-nerdlesque/351).

We're working on original choreography for Defying Gravity (from Wicked) for our [November 16th showcase](https://www.eyecandybangor.com/product/nov-16-spanksgiving/507)

⚠️  We will not have class on November 3rd ⚠️ 

Wear something comfy to class. Don't forget that Galaxy Frog says, "Stay hydrated"!
